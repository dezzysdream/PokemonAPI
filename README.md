## Notes
As a long time Pokemon fan, I've thoroughly enjoyed this app and its creation process. It is fantastic and fun being able to look over each pokemon and their individual abilities.
Because pokemomn are so unique from one another, I believe both enthusiasts and pro players can benefit from this app and being able to read in more detail about their attributes.
